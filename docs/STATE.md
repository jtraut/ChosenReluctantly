# Handoff State

> **Director: what's waiting on you is in `docs/OPEN_ITEMS.md`.**
> **Project history in plain language: `docs/CHANGELOG.md` (newest first). Code map: `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md`.**

Last updated: 2026-10-29. The director is away until the evening with an autonomous run order: after C1 and Polish 1, go on to Milestone 3 (3a run structure, 3b rewards, 3c boss, 3d loadouts). Each slice gets the full loop and, at close, a `playtest-YYYY-MM-DD-<slice>` tag plus an update to OPEN_ITEMS "While you were away".

## What's done
- Milestone 2, and **Post-milestone polish 1** (all slices). **Content slice C1** and the **capture-tooling task** closed on 2026-10-29: qa PASS 76bca75 (696/696), playtest d94676a, docs pass 4c7b490. Tag **`playtest-2026-10-29-C1`**.
- Director answers D1-D12 are recorded. D13 and D14 (healing strength, Fire Wall) are open but don't block; current values stay.
- The repo runs. Suite 696/696.

## In progress
- **Milestone 3a, run structure.** Gameplay built a7731e2..c560d83 (726/726). Next role: ux-designer.

## Exact next step
1. **3a ux** with ux-designer (RunHud, room-cleared prompt, win screen, tier markers). **On resume:** check `git log` for 3a ux commits.
2. Then qa -> playtester -> tech-writer -> game-lead close, tag `playtest-2026-10-29-3a`.
3. Then 3b, 3c, 3d in order (write each brief at the previous slice's close).

Re-run the reload soak whenever Main, Juice, Player or the autoloads change.

**Orchestration:** game-lead has the `Agent` tool. Restart with `claude --agent game-lead` and say "continue the pass". Run roles one at a time; each role commits only its own paths.

## Open questions
All director-facing items are in `docs/OPEN_ITEMS.md`.
